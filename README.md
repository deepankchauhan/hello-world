# hello-world
This simple program prints "Hello, World!" on the screen. These programs are basically for beginners to get started with programming.

Here, examples of printing "Hello, World!" using different programming languages are shown.

Notice, "\n" is used in every print statement which just means "new line" that puts the pointer on the new line. So don't get intimated by that foreign symbol.

These programs are made by Deepank Chauhan.
